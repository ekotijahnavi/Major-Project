        <p class="p">An embedded system is a computer system with a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, input/output peripheral devices that perform the task assigned. These systems are generally found in large mechanical and electrical projects. These systems control physical operations in a large structure and hence has a very large application in the field of electrical run devices.

            <h2 id="apache">How does an embedded system work?</h2>
            <img class="img-deg" src={% static "images/em.webp" %}>
            <p>Embedded systems deploy the integration of software on a motherboard with hardware in an embedded environment to perform a particular task. The three main steps involved in the working of any embedded system are:

                <br><span>1.Input- </span>The first step is taking input from the user/environment. The input can be user associated in the form of push switches, touch screens, etc. It can also be automatic values collected by sensors like humidity sensors, PIR sensors, etc.
                <br><span>2.Processing-</span>The next step is processing the input to perform the next step. This step involves calculations or algorithms which are performed on the microprocessor or microcontroller.
                <br><span>3.Output- </span>The last and the final step is the output. Based on the results obtained in the previous step the final output is displayed. This output can be in various forms based on the need of the system like the movement of a machine part, results on a screen, etc.</p>

            <h2>What are the different types of embedded systems?</h2>
            <img class="img-deg" src={% static "images/em4.jpeg" %}>
            <p>Embedded systems can be classified into four types based on their performance and functional requirements. They are as follows:
                <br><span>1.Real-time Embedded System- </span>These systems perform real-time analysis on the data and focus on quick response in critical situations. The error rate is reduced to a minimal value to avoid faults. Some examples include traffic monitoring systems, a radiation therapy system, etc.
                <br><span>2.Stand-Alone Embedded System- </span>These systems are stand-alone independent devices that are not connected to any external computers for support. These systems take the inputs and process them to operate. Some examples include microwave ovens, digital cameras, etc.
                <br><span>3.Networked Embedded System- </span>These systems are connected over some network to give output to the connected resources. The connections may be wired or wireless depending on the system. Such systems are gaining a lot of popularity these days and are widely used across different domains.
                <br><span>Mobile Embedded System-</span>These systems are small embedded systems with limited applications and memory. Some examples include cellular phones, mp3 players, digital cameras, personal digital assistants, etc.

            <h2>What programming language is used for embedded systems?</h2>
            <img class="img-deg" src={% static "images/em5.jpeg" %}>
            <p>Although there are a lot of languages that can be used for embedded systems, C programming language is most widely used in embedded systems. C++ and JAVA are other languages that find good use.</p>
                
            <p>C, as we know is one of the oldest and most powerful languages to ever emerge and hence it is an easy choice when it comes to programming in embedded systems. Here are a few reasons why C is chosen over other languages:
                
                <br>It provides low-level access.
                <br>Low memory usage of a compiled C program is a major reason behind the acceptance of C as a best-embedded programming language.
                <br>Statistically typed language- offers a great speed compared to other languages.
                <br>Its loose data typing policy makes it even more suitable for programming.
                <br>The Widespread community provides vast support for embedded systems programming.
                <br>Simple to port the embedded programs from one device to another.
                <br>Although, apart from C, there are many other programming languages that can be used in different stages. Some of those include:
                
                <br><span>C++, JAVA, RUST, PYTHON, ADA, VERILOG, B#, LUA, VHDL, Embedded C++, etc.</span></p>
            <p> Also, here are a few skills required for you to understand embedded systems better:
                
                Knowledge of programming languages like C and C++ at the very least.
                You need to be comfortable with assemble languages and have experience working with LabView.
                Need to have basic knowledge regarding the working of a microcontroller and microprocessor
                n-depth knowledge about Arduino and Raspberry pi</p>
