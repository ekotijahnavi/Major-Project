    <h1>Internet of Things</h1>
    <div class="center1">
        <img class="back" src={% static "images/em3.jpeg"%}>
        <p class="p">The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new framework with many useful features that could help many industries. The "Internet of Things" (IoT) is a network of gadgets, appliances, and other "things" that are connected and have electronics like sensors, processors, wireless network modules, and other similar parts. You can find everything from everyday household items to high-tech machinery in this category.
        </p>
        <p>The IoT is a network of devices and services that can sense and respond to their surroundings and share this information over the Internet. IoT gadgets can combine their sensor data by connecting to an IoT gateway or another edge device. They can then either send the data to the cloud for analysis or do some of the analysis locally. Sometimes, these devices share information and act based on what they have learned. People can interact with the gadgets to set them up, tell them what to do, or get the data, but the gadgets do most of the work independently.</p>

        <h2>Advantages of IoT Framework</h2>
        <p>Monitoring is the primary benefit of the IoT. It allows us to determine the precise amount of a material or the air quality inside a certain space. It can also provide additional information that previously would not have been easy to acquire.</p>
        <p>Connected and governed digitally and centrally using wi-fi technology architecture, the physical things undergo a great deal of automation and manipulation.</p>
        <p>The ability to save money is another major advantage of the Internet of Things. The IoT will be widely embraced if the cost of the tagging and monitoring equipment is small compared to the amount of money saved.</p>
        <p>The IoT benefits people because it enables their devices to connect in a way that conserves energy and costs less money.</p>
        <p>A candidate's chances of getting hired by their dream company to improve if they have an appropriate degree in IoT. Applicants with the right mix of education and experience may get top salaries.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites to do IoT Projects</h2>
        <img class="back" src={% static "images/iot2.jpeg"%}>
        <p >The IoT projects are built on connected gadgets. These IoT gadgets, which can be found on everything from industrial machinery and buildings to freight shipments and pipelines, send data and keep track of certain parameters. A common design protocol is used to create both hardware and software components for IoT projects for college students, which are then combined with a communications network. It is impossible to generalize hardware architecture due to the abundance of IoT applications currently available. But that shouldn’t prevent you from adhering to a framework. In this article, we discuss the top prerequisites for developing IoT projects.

            <h2>1.Security Requirements</h2>
            <p>IoT security is a crucial component. It must be taken into account at every step of design and development. Even while prototyping, the security and integrity of the data recorded by any device must be maintained. The IoT devices, your network, and the cloud, mobile, and web service applications all have security needs.</p>

            <h2>2.Ease of Development</h2>
            <p>In order to quickly and simply get your IoT device up and running, take data, and talk with other devices and the cloud, simplicity of development is another top priority necessity while prototyping. Take into account the support services, development tools, and API documentation provided by the hardware vendor or by the developer community</p>

            <h2>3.Data Acquisition, Processing, and Storage Requirements</h2>
            <p>The volume of data to be processed, which affects data processing and storage needs, depends on the number of connected sensors, the resolution of the data that is gathered, and the sampling rate. How frequently a device connects to transfer data upstream determines how much data has to be stored on the device.

            <h2>4.Connectivity Requirements</h2>
            <p>The operating range, the required signal transmission range, and the projected data transmission volume and rate are all connectivity requirements for wireless networking. Think about fault tolerance, which refers to a device’s capacity to rejoin and deliver data again after becoming detached.

            <h2>5.Power Requirements</h2>
            <p>The power needs of the device will be influenced by a variety of additional requirements, such as the number of sensors required and the pace of network transmission. Think if your gadget will need a portable power source, such as a battery or supercapacitor, or if it will be hardwired for electricity. If it needs a portable power source, like a battery, you need to know the specifications for the battery’s size, weight, and capacity. You also need to know if the battery has to be recharged, replaced, or thrown away after it runs out of power. </p>

            <h2>6.Physical Device Design</h2>
            <p>The shape and size of the gadget are also part of the physical device design specifications. The environment in which the item will be put must also be taken into account; will it require a ruggedized or waterproof casing, for instance.
